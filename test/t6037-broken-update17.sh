# Make sure when changing an existing command, the actual new command gets
# executed (not the old one). This became a problem when I introduced caching,
# since I forgot to update the cache when chaging the node name. This was not
# seen in any other tests because the command only gets cached early enough if
# there is a dependency from a directory to a command (as is the case with
# cpio - most normal commands don't have this).
